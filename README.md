# CPU Project

![CPU](cpu_image.PNG)

## Description

This project is a CPU implementation created as part of a computer organization course. The goal of the project was to design and build a fully functional CPU, demonstrating an understanding of complex computer systems concepts.

The CPU is designed to execute basic instructions and perform arithmetic and logical operations. It consists of various components, such as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), control unit, and registers.

## Features

- Instruction Fetch: Fetches instructions from memory for execution.
- Instruction Decode: Decodes the fetched instruction to determine the operation.
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- Control Unit: Controls the flow of data and instructions within the CPU.
- Registers: Stores data and intermediate results during execution.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): Version control system used to manage the project.
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python programming language used for simulation.
- [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/): Logic circuit simulator used for CPU design and testing.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the CPU project on your local machine for testing and exploration.
